# Spatial Point Patterns and Processes

### Part A
USing Chicago Crime Data associated to Year 2024 sourced from the City of Chicago's official data portal: https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present
 - Type of data: Crime incident reports from across Chicago.
 - Fields used:
    - ```ID```: Unique identifier for each crime incident.
    - ```Year```: Year of the incident (filtered between 2020–2024).
    - ```Latitude``` and ```Longitude```: Geographic coordinates of each crime.

- Window: The city limits of Chicago are approximated by the bounding box of the point data.

This data represents a spatial point pattern, where each crime location is treated as a point in geographic space (latitude-longitude coordinates) within a defined window.

# Part B
The Chicago crime data for 2024 can be seen as a realization of a spatial point process because:
- Each crime event is a point in geographic space.
- The region (Chicago) is the observation window.
- The exact locations result from a combination of random and systematic factors.
- The process that generates them is stochastic, not fully predictable.
Therefore, the data naturally fits the definition of a spatial point pattern.

# Part C
**Is Chicago crimes in 2024 a homogeneous Poisson process?**

No. The quadrat count test shows extreme variation in crime counts across the city, with some areas having very high concentrations and others very low. The chi-squared test produces a highly significant result (p-value < 2.2e-16), providing strong evidence that the points are not distributed completely at random. This indicates the presence of spatial clustering, meaning the pattern is not homogeneous.

**Quadrant Result:**

**Chi-Squared Test:**

```Quadrat counts:```
- Q1: 24,171
- Q2: 114,318
- Q3: 5,262
- Q4: 103,604

**Chi-squared test:**
- Chi-squared statistic = 131,178
- Degrees of freedom = 3
- p-value < 2.2e-16

**Interpretation:**

The quadrat counts show huge differences in the number of crime points across the four quadrants. For example, Quadrant 2 and Quadrant 4 have very large counts, while Quadrant 1 and Quadrant 3 have relatively few. If the point pattern were generated by a homogeneous Poisson process, we would expect the counts in each quadrat to be approximately equal or closer to each other.

The extremely large chi-squared statistic (131,178) and the very small p-value (< 2.2e-16) provide strong evidence against the null hypothesis of homogeneous Poisson process. This means the differences between quadrats are far greater than we’d expect by random chance alone.

**Complete Code:**
```
library(spatstat)
# Read data 
data <- read.csv("chicago_crimes_2024.csv")

# Create vectors for the sample coordinates
latitude <- data$Latitude
longitude <- data$Longitude

# Define window limits a bit larger than min/max
xrange <- range(longitude) + c(-0.005, 0.005)
yrange <- range(latitude) + c(-0.005, 0.005)

# Create window object
win <- owin(xrange = xrange, yrange = yrange)

# Create point pattern
pp <- ppp(x = longitude, y = latitude, window = win)

#Plot

plot(pp,
     main = "Chicago Crime Spatial Point Pattern (2024)",
     cols = "blue", 
     pch = 10,    
     cex = 0.05, 
     lwd = 1)       

# Divide region into quadrants (2 x 2)
Q <- quadratcount(pp, nx = 2, ny = 2)

# Plot the quadrat counts
plot(pp, main = "Quadrat Count Plot (2x2)")
plot(Q, add = TRUE, col = "red")

# Chi-squared test
qt <- quadrat.test(pp, nx = 2, ny = 2)
print(qt)
```
